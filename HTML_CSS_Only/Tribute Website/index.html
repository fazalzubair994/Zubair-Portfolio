                    <b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> (born <b>Mahomedali Jinnahbhai;</b> 25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948)
                    was a barrister, politician and the founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the
                    All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947, and then as the
                    Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death.

                    Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London,
                    England. Upon his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in
                    national politics, which eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the
                    Indian National Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his
                    political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact
                    between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent.
                    Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a fourteen-point
                    constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent.
                    In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
                    satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
